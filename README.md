## üìç Overview
Open-Sora is an open-source project that provides a high-performance implementation of the development pipeline that Sora might use powered by [Colossal-AI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI), including:

- Provide **a complete Sora reproduction architecture solution**, including the whole process from data processing to training and inference.
- Supports **dynamic resolution**, training can directly train any resolution of the video, without scaling.
- Supports **multiple model structures**. Since the actual model structure of Sora is unknown, we realize three common multimodal model structures such as adaLN-zero, cross attention, and in-context conditioning (token concat).
- Supports **multiple video compression methods**. Users can choose to use original video, VQVAE (video native model), SD-VAE (image native model) for training.
- Supports **multiple parallel training optimizations**. Including the AI large model system optimization capability combined with Colossal-AI, and hybrid sequence parallelism with Ulysses and FastSeq.

## üìÇ Dataset Preparation

### Use MSR-VTT

We use [MSR-VTT](https://cove.thecvf.com/datasets/839) dataset, which is a large-scale video description dataset. We should preprocess the raw videos before training the model. You can use the following scripts to perform data processing.


```bash
# Step 1: download the dataset to ./dataset/MSRVTT
bash scripts/data/download_msr_vtt_dataset.sh

# Step 2: collate the video and annotations
python scripts/data/collate_msr_vtt_dataset.py -d ./dataset/MSRVTT/ -o ./dataset/MSRVTT-collated

# Step 3: perform data processing
# NOTE: each script could several minutes so we apply the script to the dataset split individually
python scripts/data/preprocess_data.py -c ./dataset/MSRVTT-collated/train/annotations.json -v ./dataset/MSRVTT-collated/train/videos -o ./dataset/MSRVTT-processed/train
python scripts/data/preprocess_data.py -c ./dataset/MSRVTT-collated/val/annotations.json -v ./dataset/MSRVTT-collated/val/videos -o ./dataset/MSRVTT-processed/val
python scripts/data/preprocess_data.py -c ./dataset/MSRVTT-collated/test/annotations.json -v ./dataset/MSRVTT-collated/test/videos -o ./dataset/MSRVTT-processed/test
```

After completing the steps, you should have a processed MSR-VTT dataset in `./dataset/MSRVTT-processed`.


### Use Customized Datasets

You can also use other datasets and transform the dataset to the required format. You should prepare a captions file and a video directory. The captions file should be a JSON file or a JSONL file. The video directory should contain all the videos.

Here is an example of the captions file:

```json
[
    {
        "file": "video0.mp4",
        "captions": ["a girl is throwing away folded clothes", "a girl throwing cloths around"]
    },
    {
        "file": "video1.mp4",
        "captions": ["a  comparison of two opposing team football athletes"]
    }
]
```

Here is an example of the video directory:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ video0.mp4
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ video1.mp4
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

Each video may have multiple captions. So the outputs are video-caption pairs. E.g., the first video has two captions, then the output will be two video-caption pairs.

We use [VQ-VAE](https://github.com/wilson1yan/VideoGPT/) to quantize the video frames. And we use [CLIP](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/clip#clip) to extract the text features.

The output is an arrow dataset, which contains the following columns: "video_file", "video_latent_states", "text_latent_states". The dimension of "video_latent_states" is (T, H, W), and the dimension of "text_latent_states" is (S, D).

Then you can run the data processing script with the command below:

```bash
python preprocess_data.py -c /path/to/captions.json -v /path/to/video_dir -o /path/to/output_dir
```

Note that this script needs to be run on a machine with a GPU. To avoid CUDA OOM, we filter out the videos that are too long.


## üöÄ Get Started

In this section, we will provide a guidance on how to run training and inference. Before that, make sure you installed the dependencies with the command below.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training

You can invoke the training via the command below.

```bash
bash ./scripts/train.sh
```

You can also modify the arguments in `train.sh` for your own need.

### Inference

To be added.
