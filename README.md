## Open-Sora: Towards Open Reproduction of Sora

**Open-Sora** is an **open-source** initiative dedicated to **efficiently** reproducing OpenAI's Sora. Our project aims to cover **the full pipeline**, including video data preprocessing, training with acceleration, efficient inference and more. Operating on a limited budget, we prioritize the vibrant open-source community, providing access to text-to-image, image captioning, and language models. We hope to make a contribution to the community and make the project more accessible to everyone.

## üì∞ News

* **[2024.03.18]** üî• We release **Open-Sora 1.0**, an open-source project to reproduce OpenAI Sora.
Open-Sora 1.0 supports a full pipeline of video data preprocessing, training with
<a href="https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI"><img src="assets/readme/colossal_ai.png" width="8%" ></a> acceleration,
inference, and more. Our provided checkpoint can produce 2s 512x512 videos.

## üé• Latest Demo

## üîÜ New Features/Updates

- üìç Open-Sora-v1 is trained on xxx. We train the model in three stages. Model weights are available here. Training details can be found here.
- ‚úÖ Support training acceleration including flash-attention, accelerated T5, mixed precision, gradient checkpointing, splitted VAE, sequence parallelism, etc. XXX times. See more discussions [here]().
- ‚úÖ We provide video cutting and captioning tools for data preprocessing. Our data collection plan can be found [here]().
- ‚úÖ We find VQ-VAE from [] has a low quality and thus adopt a better VAE from []. We also find patching in the time dimension deteriorates the quality. See more discussions [here]().
- ‚úÖ We investigate different architectures including DiT, Latte, and our proposed STDiT. Our STDiT achieves a better trade-off between quality and speed. See more discussions [here]().
- ‚úÖ Support clip and t5 text conditioning. 
- ‚úÖ By viewing images as one-frame videos, our project supports training DiT on both images and videos (e.g., ImageNet & UCF101).
- ‚úÖ Support inference with official weights from [DiT](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DiT), [Latte](https://github.com/Vchitect/Latte), and [PixArt](https://pixart-alpha.github.io/).



### TODO list sorted by priority

- [ ] Complete the data processing pipeline (including dense optical flow, aesthetics scores, text-image similarity, deduplication, etc.). See [datasets.md]() for more information. **[WIP]**
- [ ] Training Video-VAE. **[WIP]**
- [ ] Support image and video conditioning.
- [ ] Evaluation pipeline.
- [ ] Incoporate a better scheduler, e.g., rectified flow in SD3.
- [ ] Support variable aspect ratios, resolutions, durations.
- [ ] Support SD3 when released.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hpcaitech/Open-Sora
cd Open-Sora
pip install xxx
```

After installation, to get fimilar with the project, you can check the [here]() for the project structure and how to use the config files.

## Model Weights

| Model      | #Params | url |
| ---------- | ------- | --- |
| 16x256x256 |         |     |

## Inference

```bash
python scripts/inference.py configs/opensora/inference/16x256x256.py
```

## Data Processing

### Split video into clips

We provide code to split a long video into separate clips efficiently using `multiprocessing`. See `tools/data/scene_detect.py`.
